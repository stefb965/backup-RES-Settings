{"name":"Backup-res-settings","tagline":"A simple application to make backups of settings for installs of the Reddit Enhancement Suite on your machine and store them in an archive. As well as restore saved backups, and allow conversion of settings files across browsers.","body":"#[RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) Backup Assistant\r\n\r\nBackup functionality is available and tested on OS X and Linux (with Oracle Java 7), however some features are a bit iffy. Here is a little TODO list that\r\nwill lay them out as well as allow me a list of high priority items that shouldn't be too difficult to fix.\r\n\r\n###TODO (as of V0.2.0)\r\n* Fix behavior when the RES-Backups folder already exists in the users home dir. As of right now you will be prompted to rename it to RES-Backups-OLD.\r\n\r\n* Fix duplicate issue for cases when a user has both Chrome and Chromium for example. Both files are named the same, so their index in the list will be added\r\nto the end of their file name to avoid issues.\r\n\r\n* Find out more about the .localstorage-journal file and its purpose (and then if it should be backed-up as well).\r\n\r\n###Note\r\nI cannot test most of the common issues, as I do not have access to a Windows machine. If you have a Windows machine and would like to assist in testing\r\nplease contact me. Otherwise most development will have to wait until June.\r\n\r\n####IMPORTANT!\r\nI have started working on re-writing the idea behind the backupRESSetting script into a cross-platform Java application. At first I will be implementing the \r\nbrowsers listed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Enhancement/wiki/backing_up_res_settings). However, eventually I will be willing to add support for any browser \r\nor OS that has not been covered. This readme will be updated more as the project develops.\r\n\r\n#####What: \r\n*   The application searches for RES (Reddit Ehancement Suite) installs on your computer\r\n    and make a copy of them in a folder in your user's home directory.\r\n\r\n#####Why: \r\n*   Backups are good, and especially right now for firefox users because firefox has been deleting res settings on reset.\r\n\r\n#####Who:\r\n*   This script currently only works for users running Mac OS X. I am currently working on re-writing into a cross-platform\r\nversion.\r\n\r\n#####How:\r\n*   The application works by checking the location of many different locations different browsers use to store your RES settings.  Then if\r\nthe file is found it is added to a backup file which is stored at the location you specify.\r\n\r\n* To run it simply download the latest [release](https://github.com/walshie4/backup-RES-Settings/releases) and double click it. \r\nThen click `Detect RES Installs`. Then check the installs you want to make a backup of and click `Make Backup`. \r\nA copy of the selected config files will be stored in your user's home directory in a folder called RES-Backups.\r\n\r\n#####Where:\r\n*   Check the releases for the latest working version, or download the latest commit (but don't expect it to be bug-less if you do).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
